## Where

Polymath Robotics \
375 Alabama St #360, \
San Francisco, CA 94110 \

Polymath Robotics invites fellow San Francisco & Bay Area robot makers to an evening of board games and camaraderie!

This one will be a way to kick off the "ROScon season" as some of us prepare to leave for Singapore, and the rest to watch with excitement those live talks at midnight local time.

There will be pizza, beverages, and games provided - but feel free to bring your own to share.

**Entrance**:
- Call number 002 on the keypad and somebody will buzz you in
- Take the stairs or go around the right side to the elevator, up to floor 3
- Go straight down the hallway and the Polymath offices will be on the left hand side
- If stuck, message Emerson Knapp or Aaron via the phone number in the email thread (or OSRF Zulip!)

### Parking and Transit

**Parking**: There is street parking in the area, even right outside, but it has unpredictable availability. Be aware if driving you may need to circle to find parking on nearby blocks.

**Public Transit**: The office is a 10 minute walk from the 16th St Mission BART station. There are plenty of bus stops within a couple blocks as well, serviced by the 22 line and others.
